# BOHOHOYT CS210 Project

This is the repository for Bohohoyt team's CS210 project.

You can find raw datasets in `raw_datasets/`. The folder includes the datasets before we processed them. You can check our project report to access yourself. FAIR principles are important for us and we provide links for all sources.

You can find processed datasets in `datasets/`. We proccessed all data we got to merge them all into a giant dataset in `model.ipynb`.

You can find scripts in `scripts/`. The folder includes PyPDF2 scripts to process PDF files, web scrapping scripts, format convertion scripts, and API scripts.

We believed in FAIR principles and therefore, we share everything we have with access. You can check and train your model!

## Thank you for that amazing semester!
